Phase 3 project summary:

This will be a 2 section repository application. One repository is used to develop the front end client side UI that is developed with Javascript, React.js, HTML & CSS. The other repository is used for the back end and will be developed with Ruby, ActiveRecord, SQL, and Sinatra.

Main Goals:

User will be directed to our home page which will populate a list of movies. Each movie will have a Name, description, img URL, review, and favorite button. Users can click on each movie card to show more information about each movie (reviews, length of movie, release date, box office etcâ€¦) There will be a nav bar at the top that can navigate you to different pages (home page about the website, favorites page to see all of your favorite movies and/or add your own movie/tv show to the database with your own review)
